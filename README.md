# 2022 Python Tkinter Project Using Search and Sort Algorithms

## What is the system?
The system provides users a service that will catalogue the specific domain, movies, where
the user can search for a number of movies based on the user input to search. The system
includes searching and sorting algorithms in python that identifies keywords associated with
the searched movie, displaying a view of all associated movies. In addition to the searching
function, the user will have the ability to filter the search results and sort them in ascending or
descending order.

## Objectives of the system
The requirements of the catalogue system should enhance usability of searching for content
specific to the user’s needs. Therefore, the objectives of the system includes:
* The ability to search for a specific movie or multiple movies
* The system should associate keywords with a movie
* The system should match the input data with the stored keywords in the dataset
* The system should pair up pre-set keywords with the name of the film for system to find
    the searched movie
* The system should return all movies associated with the input data the user has entered
* The system should sort the list of keywords associated with the movies to improve and
    enhance the use of sorting and the search for movies
    
Overall, the system should provide the ability to efficiently search for movies the user wants to
view by identifying, extracting, indexing, sorting keywords, and searching for keywords in a
given dataset that matches the user’s input data.
